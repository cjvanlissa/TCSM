"When comparing males and females using a regression model, the correct equation is: $y_i = b_0 + b_1*Male_i + b_2*Female_i + e_i$","""TRUE""",FALSE,"In the regression specification, you would use the intercept and one dummy, not two dummies. In the ANOVA specification, you would use no intercept and two dummies. You would never use and intercept AND two dummies; that model is not identified."
"If two groups differ on the covariate in an ANCOVA, we say there is an interaction.","""TRUE""",FALSE,"This situation merely implies that the covariate is correlated with the grouping variable."
"When interested in causal relationships, experimental research is preferred over correlational research.","""FALSE""",TRUE,"Experimental research ensures precedence in time and exclusion of all alternative explanations thanks to random assignment. If you also find an association, all requirements for causality are met."
Random assignment in an experimental design ensures that two groups will be equal on all covariates,"""TRUE""",FALSE,"Random assignment gives you the highest *probability* that two groups will be equal on any observed or non-observed covariates, and it ensures that any remaining differences are due to chance - but there can still be observed differences between the groups due to chance."
"Nonspuriousness means that...","c(""a relationship is causal in nature"", ""a relationship is not due to random chance"", ""a relationship generalizes to new samples"")","a relationship holds even if the influences of other variables are eliminated","A spurious relationship means that two variables are associated but not causally related, due to either coincidence or the presence of a certain third, unseen variable. Nonspuriousness thus means that the reationship persists if such third variables are eliminated."
Adding covariates in ANCOVA can...,"c(""...decrease power to detect an effect by increasing the residual sum of squares"", ""...increase power to detect an effect by increasing the model sum of squares"", ""...decrease power to detect an effect by increasing the total sum of squares"")",...increase power to detect an effect by reducing the residual sum of squares,"The F value for each effect is computed based on a sum of squares (or mean square) for that effect, divided by the residual sum of squares (or mean squared residual). Including covariates explains some variance, and thus reduces the residual sum of squares. The F value for each effect thus increases. See Lecture, slide 36."
If the regression lines between a covariate and the outcome are not parallel for two groups in ANCOVA then...,"c(""...the effect must be nonlinear."", ""...the grouping variable and covariate must be correlated."", ""...the data cannot have come from a random sample."")",...there must be an interaction between the grouping variable and covariate,"If the lines are not parallel, then the regression effect is different between the groups. This is called an interaction: the effect of the covariate is contingent on group membership. See Lecture, slide 41."
