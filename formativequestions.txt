In regression, R-square indicated the fit of your model to the data.
 True False
 
15. In structural equation modeling, fit is based on differences between the observed
covariance matrix and the model-implied covariance matrix.
True False 

 8. In a well fitting structural equation model, most of the variance in the
dependent variable can be explained.
True False





6. In moderation analysis, the relationships between the independent variable,
dependent variable and moderator, always have to be linear.
 True False 



A quadratic relationship could be interpreted as an interaction of a predictor with itself.	"FALSE"	TRUE	This is true; to estimate an interaction effect, you multiply predictor X1 with predictor X2 to get interaction term X1*X2. To estimate a quadratic effect, you multiply predictor X1 with itself to get quadratic term X1*X1, or X1^2.
