In regression, R-square indicated the fit of your model to the data.
 True False
 
15. In structural equation modeling, fit is based on differences between the observed
covariance matrix and the model-implied covariance matrix.
True False 

 8. In a well fitting structural equation model, most of the variance in the
dependent variable can be explained.
True False





6. In moderation analysis, the relationships between the independent variable,
dependent variable and moderator, always have to be linear.
 True False 



13. Modification indices indicate how much the Chi-square will increase when
you fix this parameter to zero.
True False
