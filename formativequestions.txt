11. When interested in causal relationships, experimental research is preferred
over correlational research.
True False


In regression, R-square indicated the fit of your model to the data.
 True False
 
15. In structural equation modeling, fit is based on differences between the observed
covariance matrix and the model-implied covariance matrix.
True False 

 8. In a well fitting structural equation model, most of the variance in the
dependent variable can be explained.
True False


1. Varimax is a form of orthogonal rotation in factor analysis
True False
3. Factor analysis is a statistical technique aimed at data reduction
 True False
 4. The errors assigned to each observed variable in a confirmatory factor
analysis, are also called unique variances.
 True False
 
12.When comparing males and females using a regression model, the correct
equation is: yi = b0 + b1 Malei + b2 Femalei + ei
True False
10. If the groups differ on the covariate in an ANCOVA, we say there is an
interaction.
True False


5. In comparing nested models in SEM, one chooses the model with the
largest p-value for the Chi-square test of model fit
 True False

6. In moderation analysis, the relationships between the independent variable,
dependent variable and moderator, always have to be linear.
 True False 

7. In a fully-mediated model, the direct effect between the independent and
dependent variable has to be insignificant
True False
9. A confounder is a special case of a mediator.
True False
14.An advantage of investigating mediation using structural equation modeling
rather than the three steps of Baron and Kenny is that it allows you to
investigate more complicated models.
True False




13. Modification indices indicate how much the Chi-square will increase when
you fix this parameter to zero.
True False
