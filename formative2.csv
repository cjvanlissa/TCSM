"When conducting an exploratory factor analysis, cross-loadings are assumed to be zero.","""TRUE""",FALSE,"In exploratory factor analysis, all items load on all factors. Thus, all possible cross-loadings are estimated (even if we sometimes suppress small ones in the output). See Lecture, slide 38 (EFA)."
Promax rotation in factor analysis is a specific form of orthogonal rotation.,"""TRUE""",FALSE,"Promax rotation is an oblique rotation which is computationally faster than oblimin. See Lecture, slide 52 (Factor Rotation)."
What is the maximum number of latent variables when conducting Exploratory Factor Analysis with 5 items?,"c(""Only one; you need at least 3 indicators per latent variable."", ""Two; you need 3 indicators for one latent variable, but the model is still identified due to the covariance between latent variables."", ""No limit; you can keep adding latent variables, but they will explain ever decreasing amounts of variance."")",Five; the same as the number of indicators.,"You can perform exploratory factor analysis with at most as many factors as indicators (but typically a theoretical maximum is set). See: Lecture, e.g. parallel analysis goes up to the number of indicators."
EFA models the covariances among items; PCA describes the total variance of items.,"""FALSE""",TRUE,"EFA estimates a measurement model on the covariance matrix of the items; in this model, all cross-loadings are estimated, and certain constraints are imposed to make the model identified. PCA is just a rotation of the data in space. It thus explains the total variance of the data. See Lecture, slide 15."
"With PCA, you must indicate the number of factors to extract a-priori.","""TRUE""",FALSE,"PCA merely rotates the data in space. Every item adds a dimension to that space (so 3 indicators = 3-dimensional space). Software may allow you to specify the number of components (not factors) you are interested in - but that does not change the analysis, it just means the remaining components are omitted from the output. See Lecture, slide 16."
Varimax is a form of orthogonal rotation in factor analysis,"""FALSE""",TRUE,"Varimax is an orthogonal rotation; that means that it results in uncorrelated factors. See Lecture, slide 52 (Factor Rotation)."
Factor analysis is a statistical technique aimed at data reduction.,"""TRUE""",FALSE,"Factor analysis fits a theoretical (causal) measurement model to the data. It assumes that your observed variables are indicators of unobserved latent constructs. The term 'data reduction' implies that you are only interested in reducing the dimensions of potentially redundant/multicolinear items, without having a theoretical model. In that case, principal components analysis is more suitable. It merely rotates your data so that the first components explain most of the variance in all items. See Lecture, slide 7."
<p>![](formative2.png){width=50%}</p>What kind of model is displayed above?,"c(""An Item Response Theory Analysis"", ""Confirmatory Factor Analysis"", ""Principal Components Analysis"")",Exploratory Factor Analysis,"You can tell this is exploratory factor analysis because 1) all items load on all factors, and 2) the arrows point from the factor to the items, meaning we assume a latent variable causes the item responses, and 3) the items have residual variances. See lecture, slides 36-39."
"Order these methods for determining the number of factors from least subjective to most subjective: 1) Kaiser's criterion, 2) Scree plot, 3) Parallel analysis.","c(""1, 2, 3"", ""2, 1, 3"", ""3, 2, 1"")","3, 1, 2","Parallel analysis is an objective method for determining the correct number of factors, based on a permutation test. Kaiser's criterion (retain factors with Eigenvalue > 1) may be a bit arbitrary, but at least it has an objective threshold. Interpreting scree plots is fully subjective. See Lecture, slide 46."
Which of these is not a valid method for choosing the correct number of factors?,"c(""Kaiser's criterion"", ""Scree plot"", ""Parallel analysis"", ""Theory"")",Ability to predict a criterion scale.,"The only method not suitable for determining the correct number of factors is ability to predict a criterion scale. Factor analysis and PCA are about understanding the structure of a scale. This is related to internal validity and reliability. Ability to predict an a criterion scale is used to verify the external validity of a scale. See Lecture, slide 46."
