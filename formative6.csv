A moderator is…,"c(""A third variable that explains why X and Y are related."", ""A third variable that explains unique variance in Y relative to X."", ""A third variable that causes both X and Y."")",A third variable that changes the relationship between X and Y.,"Moderation means that one variable attenuates (influences) the strength (and sometimes sign) of the relationship between two other variables. See Lecture, slide 4."
Modification indices indicate how much the Chi-square will increase when you fix this parameter to zero.,"""TRUE""",FALSE,"False; the modification index estimates how much chi square will decrease (how much misfit is reduced) by freeing a specific parameter. See Lecture, slide 62."
Which of these is not a risk of using modification indices?,"c(""Overfitting the model; which means: modeling noise unique to the current dataset, thus improving the fit of the model to the current data, but reducing its generalizability and fit to future datasets."", ""Specifying paths that improve fit, but do not make theoretical sense."", ""Conducting exploratory analyses, but still presenting the findings as hypothesis-testing (confirmatory) research."")",Making modifications that reduce fit to the data.,"Using modification indices has many risks, but one thing is certain: by freeing more parameters, you cannot reduce model fit. Model fit will always be better (although sometimes not very much) when you free more parameters. See Lecture, slide 64."
"When comparing two groups (e.g., experimental vs control group), which one of these is not an advantage of multi-group modeling (MGM) over single-group analysis with a dummy for group membership (dummy)?","c(""With MGM, both groups can have unique residual variances; dummy analysis assumes homogeneity of variance."", ""With MGM, you can have group-specific predictors; dummy analysis assumes predictors are equal."", ""MGM can account for measurement variance (latent variables do not measure the exact same thing across both groups); dummy analysis assumes measurement invariance."")","With MGM, you can have different dependent variables across groups; with dummy analysis, you have only one dependent variable.","If you used different dependent variables across two groups in a multi-group analysis, the models in the two groups are not nested and thus incomparable. It is possible, however, to have different independent variables across the two groups: This simply means that the regression coefficient for some of the independent variables are constrained to zero in one of the groups. This is a general insight question; there are no specific slides explaining this - but look at sections on nested models (week 2) and multi-group analysis (week 6)."
It is not possible to use multi-group analysis to investigate moderation with a continuous moderator.,"""FALSE""",TRUE,"True; with categorical moderators, you can run a multi-group model with separate groups for each category of the moderator. Continuous moderators cannot be split like that. You must compute an interaction term by multiplying the moderator with the predictor it moderates. See Lecture, slide 33."
Centering predictors in moderation analysis affects both model fit and model interpretation.,"""TRUE""",FALSE,"Centering does not affect model fit; imagine you move a scatterplot along the X or Y axis. This does not change the relationship between X and Y. Centering does influence interpretation, however. Before you center, the effect of each variable can be interpreted as the expected effect for that variable for people who score zero on all other variables. After you center predictors, the effect of each variable can be interpreted as the expected effect for that variable for people with the average value on all other variables. See Lecture, slide 9."
"According to Barron and Kenny, there are many ways to investigate moderation - but all of them can be specified as a structural equation model.","""FALSE""",TRUE,"True; SEM is a more general modeling framework that incorporates many specific types of analysis, including AN(C)OVA, regression, correlation analysis, etc. See Lecture, slide 5."
