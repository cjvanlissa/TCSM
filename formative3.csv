Rotation can be applied to the loadings of both EFA and CFA.,"""TRUE""",FALSE,"In order to rotate the loadings, you need a matrix with loadings for all items on all factors. With CFA, the cross-loadings are fixed at zero. See Lecture, slide 3."
"In CFA, some parameters must be constrained in order to make the model identified.","""FALSE""",TRUE,"Your latent variable does not have a scale; you must give it one by either fixing the variance to 1, or fixing one loading to 1, which makes the scale equal to the scale of that item. See Lecture, slide 8."
The minimum number of items for a CFA is...,"c(""1"", ""2"", ""5"")",3,"You must have three items, which gives you 6 pieces of information, in order to have a just-identified CFA."
"A researcher has developed a new questionnaire that should measure depression, and wants to know how many factors there are. Which technique would you use?","c(""PCA"", ""CFA"")",EFA,"EFA would be a good choice, because there is a theory about a latent construct, but that construct might be multidimensional. This is yet to be established - and EFA is a good technique for establishing that. Remember:  PCA – summary of variance of items; EFA – given the data, how many factors are there?; CFA – is my theoretical model supported by my data?"
"Generally, more factor loadings are estimated in a EFA model than in a CFA model","""FALSE""",TRUE,The EFA model estimates all possible cross-loadings; the CFA model does not.
PCA and EFA both assume that indicator variables do not have measurement error,"""TRUE""",FALSE,"False; PCA is simply a rotation of the data; it does not fit a model and therefore does not split up the variance into explained- and unexplained (error) variance. EFA does fit a model, and thus leaves unexplained error variance."
Which of these methods is valid for choosing the correct number of factors in CFA?,"c(""Kaiser's criterion"", ""Scree plot"", ""Parallel analysis"", ""Ability to predict a criterion scale."")",Theory,"The only method suitable for determining the correct number of factors in CFA is theory; you are fitting a theoretical model to the data. Of course, that theory may be inspired by prior exploratory work - but you should not use exploration and confirmation on the same dataset."
