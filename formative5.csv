"In comparing nested models in SEM, one chooses the model with the largest p-value for the Chi-square test of model fit.","""TRUE""",FALSE,"The chi-square test of model fit is not used for model comparison. When comparing two specific nested models, you can conduct a chi-square *difference* test. If this is not significant, the simpler model is preferred. When comparing a set of nested models, use any of the fit indices to determine which one fits best. See: Recurring topic, lecture 1 and others."
"A model is called ""fully mediated"" when the direct effect between the independent and dependent variable is non-significant.","""FALSE""",TRUE,"A fully mediated model has a significant total effect from X on Y, which becomes non-significant when accounting for the indirect effect through M. See: Lecture, slide 20."
A confounder is a special case of a mediator.,"""TRUE""",FALSE,"We speak of confounding when a third variable causes both X and Y, thus making them appear to be associated. Mediation is a different model for three variables: in mediation, we assume that the third variable M is a process variable that explains why X and Y are associated. Note that we cannot distinguish between these two situations based on statistical criteria; we must use theory or the experimental method to determing whether a third variable is a confounder or mediator. See: Lecture, slide 10."
"In order to for mediation to exist, there must also exist a total effect between X and Y.","""TRUE""",FALSE,"It is possible that the total effect is near-zero and non-significant if, for example, the direct effect and the indirect effect are of opposite signs and cancel each other out. This is called suppression. See Lecture, slide 18."
When are model A and B nested?,"c(""If both model use the same dependent variables"", ""If both models use exactly the same covariance matrix"", ""If both models have an equal number of DF"")",If one model is obtained by constraining some parameters of the other model,"Models are nested when you can derive the simpler model by constraining some parameters of the more complex model (e.g., constraining them to zero or to be equal to each other). See Lecture, slide 21."
Bootstrapping…,"c(""...empirically derives the sampling distribution by randomly shuffling the data many times, and calculating the bootstrapped parameters in each sample."", ""...better estimates the population value of parameters by randomly sampling from the data many times, and calculating the bootstrapped parameters in each sample."", ""...better estimates the population value of parameters by randomly sampling from the data many times, and calculating the bootstrapped parameters in each sample."")","...empirically derives the sampling distribution by randomly sampling from the data many times, and calculating the bootstrapped parameters in each sample.","The sampling distribution is what you would get if you drew many samples from the population, and calculated a parameter in each of those samples. Bootstrapping simply replaces the population with your original sample, and draws many samples (with replacement) from your original sample, then calculates the parameter in each of those samples. If your sample is representative, then this approximately represents the sampling distribution. Lecture, slide 38."
