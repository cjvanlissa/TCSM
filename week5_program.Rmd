Introducing means into statistical models/How can I investigate mediation?

**Homework for the lecture Mediation:**

Researchers often have theories about possible causal relationships between variables. A particularly important topic in this respect is mediation, in which variable X influences variable Y through a third variable, the mediator. For instance, psychotherapy (X), may affect thoughts (mediator), which in turn affects mood (Y). 

Read this weekâ€™s literature and finish the reading questions before coming to the lecture.

**Lecture Mediation:**

There are two approaches to investigating mediation. The first approach is within the context of multiple linear regression analysis. The second approach is based on path models, which form a special case of Structural Equation Modeling. We consider both and discuss their advantages and weaknesses.

**Homework for the practical Mediation:**

Perform take home exercise mediation before coming to the practical.
	
**Practical Mediation:**

During the practical we will discuss take home exercise mediation. In the remainder of the practical an introduction into estimating mediation and path models in lavaan will be given.
